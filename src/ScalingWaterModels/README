Combined contains actual (cavitation data) spinodal data for ST2
Combined-01 contains actual spinodal data offset by 25MPa for ST2
Combined-02 contains actual spinodal data offset by 50MPa for ST2
Combined-03 contains actual spinodal data offset by 50MPa and show critical pt for ST2
Combined-04 contains actual spinodal data offset by -50MPa, shows critical pt, and matches critical pt
try to match location of reduced pressure for critical point

#new rescaling
two part
P/Pc and P-Ps
determine crossover point by continuity between P/Pc = (P-Ps)/(ref. Pc molecule)
use a switch based on extrema of extrema, such that each point is rescaled
consider dimensionality reduction method to brute force problem
