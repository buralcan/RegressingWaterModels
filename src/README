and ANOVA
results --> F-statistic and anova analyis is the best response of pressure
as a function of temperature is quadratic with respect to the spinodal, with
target significance of less than 0.1%
check A vs T fit --> anova shows that polynomial of order 2 is best fit for A
vs T data, considerations assigning lower weights to low temperature data, and
considering a significance of 0.1%	
looks like i am missing a kts component to spinodal
check mathematica script
best of the best is best*_3
